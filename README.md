## What Is New in v1.2.8

Version `1.2.8` focuses on torrent reliability and better torrent management.

AzuDl now reads the torrent `InfoHash` before adding a `.torrent` file to aria2. If the same torrent already exists in aria2, AzuDl does not add a duplicate torrent. It detects the existing GID, resumes or monitors the existing task, and if the existing torrent is in an error state, it removes it and adds the torrent again.

This prevents common aria2 errors like:

```text
InfoHash is already registered
```

<details>
<summary><strong>What is new in v1.3.0 GUI Beta?</strong></summary>

<br>

Version `1.3.0 GUI Beta` adds a new Google Colab widget-based graphical interface for AzuDl - GC2GD.

This beta release keeps the original CLI workflow available, but adds a tab-based GUI for users who prefer buttons, forms, dropdowns, checkboxes, and visual controls instead of typing menu numbers.

The GUI is designed to make AzuDl easier to use for public GitHub users, especially new users who want to download direct links, YouTube videos, torrents, batch links, manage files, check storage, and access help tools from one interface.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GUI Highlights</strong></summary>

<br>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Default Interface</strong></summary>

<br>

Starting from `1.3.0 GUI Beta`, the default interface is the GUI.

When the notebook cell is run normally, AzuDl launches the Colab GUI automatically:

```python
launch_gui()
```

The classic CLI is still available:

```python
main()
```

You can also force CLI mode before running the script:

```python
import os
os.environ["AZUDL_INTERFACE"] = "cli"
```

This is a beta GUI release. The download engine is still based on the same AzuDl core features, including aria2, yt-dlp, Google Drive storage, history, ZIP tools, SHA256 tools, and aria2 session persistence.

The GUI may receive visual improvements, layout changes, and usability updates in future versions.

---

## Storage Structure

AzuDl creates the following folder structure in Google Drive:

```text
/content/drive/MyDrive/AzuDl-GC2GD
```

```text
AzuDl-GC2GD/
├── TorrentDownloads/
├── YouTubeDownloads/
├── DirectDownloads/
├── BatchDownloads/
├── Archives/
└── Logs/
```

| Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TorrentDownloads` | Torrent magnet and `.torrent` downloads |
| `YouTubeDownloads` | YouTube video, playlist, and audio downloads |
| `DirectDownloads` | Direct URL downloads |
| `BatchDownloads` | Batch download outputs |
| `Archives` | ZIP files created by AzuDl |
| `Logs` | History, aria2 session file, cookies templates, token templates, and debug files |

---

## aria2 Session File

AzuDl stores aria2 session data here:

```text
/content/drive/MyDrive/AzuDl-GC2GD/Logs/aria2.session
```

This file helps aria2 reload unfinished tasks after restarting the notebook.

AzuDl uses:

```text
--continue=true
--always-resume=true
--save-session
--input-file
--force-save=true
```

This makes downloads more resume-friendly.

---

## Important Note About Google Colab Timeout

AzuDl does not bypass Google Colab timeout. Google Colab may disconnect idle or long-running sessions depending on its runtime policies.

AzuDl improves reliability by saving aria2 session data, saving files directly to Google Drive, enabling resume options in aria2, detecting existing torrent tasks, and continuing existing aria2 jobs where possible.

For long-term torrent seeding or unattended downloading, use a VPS or seedbox.

---

## Supported Link Types

AzuDl can automatically detect:

```text
magnet:?...
https://example.com/file.zip
https://example.com/file.torrent
https://youtube.com/...
https://youtu.be/...
```

| Type | Supported |
|---|---|
| Direct HTTP/HTTPS links | Yes |
| FTP links | Yes |
| YouTube videos | Yes |
| YouTube playlists | Yes |
| Magnet links | Yes |
| `.torrent` URLs | Yes |
| Local `.torrent` files | Yes |
| Batch links | Yes |

---

## Direct Downloads

AzuDl can download direct links using aria2.

Examples:

```text
https://example.com/file.zip
https://example.com/video.mp4
https://example.com/archive.rar
https://example.com/document.pdf
```

Optional fields:

- Folder name
- Output file name
- Speed limit
- Custom headers as JSON

Example custom headers:

```json
{"User-Agent":"Mozilla/5.0","Referer":"https://example.com"}
```

---

## YouTube Downloads

AzuDl uses `yt-dlp` to download YouTube videos and playlists.

Supported options:

- Best quality
- Quality selection
- Audio-only MP3
- Playlist download
- Metadata saving
- Thumbnail saving
- Cookie file support
- PO Token support

Available quality values:

```text
best
4320
2160
1440
1080
720
480
360
240
144
```

---

## YouTube Cookies

Some YouTube downloads may fail in Colab with authentication, age restriction, or bot-check messages.

Recommended fix:

Use a Netscape-format `cookies.txt` file exported from your own logged-in browser session.

Accepted cookie paths:

```text
/content/cookies.txt
/content/youtube_cookies.txt
/content/drive/MyDrive/AzuDl-GC2GD/Logs/youtube_cookies.txt
/content/drive/MyDrive/AzuDl-GC2GD/youtube_cookies.txt
/content/drive/MyDrive/AzuDl-GC2GD/cookies.txt
```

Environment variable alternative:

```text
AZUDL_YOUTUBE_COOKIES=/path/to/cookies.txt
```

Cookie safety:

```text
Never publish, share, or commit real cookies to GitHub.
```

---

## YouTube PO Token

PO Token means Proof Of Origin Token. It is an advanced `yt-dlp` option for YouTube clients and should be used only when anonymous access and `cookies.txt` both fail.

AzuDl reads PO Token values from:

```text
/content/drive/MyDrive/AzuDl-GC2GD/Logs/youtube_po_token.txt
```

Recommended token line format:

```text
mweb+YOUR_PO_TOKEN
```

Optional Visitor Data path:

```text
/content/drive/MyDrive/AzuDl-GC2GD/Logs/youtube_visitor_data.txt
```

Environment variables also work:

```text
AZUDL_YOUTUBE_PO_TOKEN
AZUDL_YOUTUBE_VISITOR_DATA
AZUDL_YOUTUBE_PLAYER_CLIENT
```

---

## YouTube Audio Fix

Some YouTube formats are video-only, especially high quality formats.

For example:

```text
137
```

is often a video-only format.

AzuDl automatically tries to add the best available audio:

```text
137 -> 137+ba/best
```

Recommended custom format examples:

```text
137+140
248+251
22
18
best
```

---

## MP3 Audio Extraction

Choose audio-only mode to extract audio as:

```text
MP3 320kbps
```

---

## Torrent Downloads

AzuDl supports magnet links, `.torrent` file URLs, local `.torrent` files, private torrent mode, optional seeding, live download progress, live seeding status, duplicate InfoHash handling, and aria2 resume/session persistence.

### Magnet example

```text
magnet:?xt=urn:btih:EXAMPLE_HASH
```

Use:

```text
Torrent Tools > Torrent magnet
```

### Torrent file example

```text
https://example.com/file.torrent
```

Use:

```text
Torrent Tools > Torrent file
```

For public torrents, use `Torrent file`, not `Private torrent`.

---

## Private Torrent Mode

Private torrent mode is designed for private trackers.

Use:

```text
Torrent Tools > Private torrent
```

Recommended input:

```text
.torrent file from your private tracker
```

Private mode disables:

```text
DHT
DHT6
PEX
LPD
```

This is important for private trackers because many private trackers do not allow public peer discovery.

---

## Seeding

When AzuDl asks:

```text
Keep seeding after download? y/n
```

Choose:

```text
y
```

to keep seeding after the download completes.

AzuDl displays live seeding information:

```text
Upload speed
Uploaded size
Ratio
Connections
Seeders
Elapsed seeding time
```

Example:

```text
Seeding Upload: up=1.20 MB/s, uploaded=350.40 MB, ratio=0.42, connections=8, seeders=12, time=08:31
```

Seeding only works while the Colab runtime is alive. For long-term seeding, use a VPS, seedbox, or dedicated server.

---

## Why AzuDl Uses 525600 Minutes for Seeding

Some aria2 builds do not accept:

```text
seed-time=-1
```

So AzuDl uses:

```text
525600
```

This means 525600 minutes, which is around one year. Since Colab will disconnect much earlier than that, this effectively means: seed as long as the Colab runtime is alive.

---

## Duplicate Torrent Handling

AzuDl reads the torrent InfoHash before adding `.torrent` files. If the torrent is already registered in aria2, AzuDl will detect the existing torrent, show the existing GID, resume or monitor the existing task, and remove and re-add it if the existing task is errored.

---

## aria2 Status

Use:

```text
Torrent Tools > aria2 status
```

This shows:

```text
GID
Status
Name
InfoHash
Progress
Completed size
Download speed
Upload speed
Uploaded size
Ratio
Connections
Seeders
Errors
```

---

## Removing a Torrent Task

Use:

```text
Torrent Tools > Remove aria2 GID
```

Then paste the GID shown in aria2 status.

This can be useful when a torrent is stuck, duplicated, errored, or when you want to stop a seeding task.

---

## Batch Download

Batch download allows multiple links to be downloaded one by one.

Supported in batch mode:

- Direct links
- YouTube links
- Magnet links
- `.torrent` links

Unknown links are skipped.

---

## Download History

AzuDl stores download history in:

```text
/content/drive/MyDrive/AzuDl-GC2GD/Logs/download_history.json
```

History includes type, source, output, status, time, format, seed mode, and error message.

---

## File Management Tools

AzuDl includes:

```text
List downloaded files
Show latest file
Storage report
SHA256 latest file
SHA256 selected file
ZIP folder
ZIP latest folder
```

ZIP files are saved in:

```text
/content/drive/MyDrive/AzuDl-GC2GD/Archives
```

---

## Speed Limit Examples

```text
500K
2M
10M
```

Leave empty for no speed limit.

---

## Requirements

AzuDl installs required packages inside Colab:

```bash
apt install -y aria2 ffmpeg p7zip-full
pip install tqdm requests yt-dlp ipywidgets
```

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| aria2 | Direct, torrent, magnet downloads |
| ffmpeg | YouTube merging and audio extraction |
| yt-dlp | YouTube download engine |
| tqdm | Progress bars |
| requests | HTTP requests |
| ipywidgets | Colab GUI interface |
| p7zip-full | Archive support |

---

## How to Use

1. Open Google Colab: `https://colab.research.google.com`
2. Create a new notebook.
3. Paste the full AzuDl code into a cell.
4. Run the cell.
5. Authorize Google Drive mount.
